## SEARCH ALGORITHMS

This repository has the problems in the SEARCH track of the DFD self-paced
Time complexity of binary search is log(n)
We have log(n) time complexity for recursive function also.
By time complexity both the iterative and recursive methods work the same.
But the recursive method requires some extra auxiliary space.
The recursive function call requires O(log n) auxiliary space on the other hand the iterative
function call requires O(1) time.
Iterative is better than recursive
for a successful search the time complexity will be height of the binary tree in the worst
case that is ceiling(log(n))
